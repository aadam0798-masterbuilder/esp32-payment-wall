ESP32 QR Payment Wall project
project description:
The ESP32 QR Payment Wall is an embedded hardware project designed to display a QR code for digital payments using UPI. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller with WiFi connectivity to generate and show a payment QR code with a preset amount on a display or web interface. Customers can scan the QR code using any UPI-supported mobile application (such as Google Pay, PhonePe, or Paytm) to make payments.

The project is intended for learning and prototyping purposes in the field of IoT and digital payments. It demonstrates the integration of microcontrollers, WiFi networking, and payment systems. The device can be used in small kiosks, vending machines, or donation counters as a smart payment interface.

In future development, the system can be expanded to include payment verification, transaction logging, and automatic refund features using payment gateway APIs. The project focuses on building a low-cost, secure, and user-friendly digital payment solution using embedded systems technology.
